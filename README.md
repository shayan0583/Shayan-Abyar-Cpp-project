Part 1 :

We have two files, the Vector1 file is a vector that has functions resize, insert, and remove
And from the shape function that occupies 10 megabytes, we added ten times to the vector that we made from the shape class.
And then we deleted them
And we got the total time and the average time in Vector1.png .

And the Vector2(Pointer) file is a vector that has functions resize, insert, and remove
And from the shape function that occupies 10 megabytes, we added ten times to the vector that we made from the shape class.
And then we deleted them
And we got the total time and the average time in Vector2.png .

The Result : We found that Vector 2 (With T**) is faster than Vector1 (with T*).


Part 2 : 

first --> create cube , sphere , cylinder for each 3 devices and Calculate their total (Volume , Area , Mass) by EvalVolume , EValArea , EvalMass functions

next --> by adddevice function add all of devices in device_total and Calculate their total (Volume , Area , Mass)
